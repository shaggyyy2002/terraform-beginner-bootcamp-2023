## Terraform Installation using bash scripting
To install terraform automatically we are using bash scripts which we are going to create throughout the bootcamp. 
[Install terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

**Bash file:** 
``` source ./bin/install-terraform-cli/sh ```


## Semantic Versioning
In this bootcamp we are using semantic versioning. If you're unsure what it is check the below link on how it works.
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes <br>
